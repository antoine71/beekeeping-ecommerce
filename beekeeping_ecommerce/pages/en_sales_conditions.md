## Preamble

NUMERICBEES has set up an e-commerce site accessible via the Internet at the address [https://www.numericbees.com/](https://www.numericbees.com/). It is open to all users of this network (hereinafter referred to as "Internet users or prospects"). It is published by the company NUMERICBEES, SAS with a capital of 1000 €, whose head office is in LYON, 69003, 56, Rue du Dauphiné, registered in the Trade and Companies Register of LYON under the number 902 826 551, hereinafter referred to as the "seller.

The site allows NUMERICBEES to offer beekeeping articles and accessories for sale (hereinafter referred to as "products") to Internet users browsing the site. For the purposes of these terms and conditions, it is agreed that the Internet user and NUMERICBEES will be collectively referred to as the "parties" and individually referred to as the "party". The Internet user who has validated an order will then be referred to as the "customer". The rights and obligations of the Internet user necessarily apply to the "customer".

The "customer", prior to placing an order, declares that he/she has the full legal capacity to commit himself/herself under these general terms of sale.

Any order for a Product offered on the Site implies consultation and acceptance of these general terms and conditions of sale, without this acceptance being conditional on a handwritten signature by the User. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 1365 to 1368 of the Civil Code, supplemented by Decree No. 2001-272 of 30 March 2001, taken for the application of Article 1367 of the Civil Code and relating to the electronic signature, it is recalled that the validation of the order form as specified in Article 3.3 below, constitutes an electronic signature which has, between the Parties, the same value as a handwritten signature.

These general conditions of sale do not apply to any other sales channel through which a NUMERICBEES product could have been acquired.

## 1. object

The purpose of the present general conditions of sale is, on the one hand, to inform any Internet user about the conditions and modalities under which NUMERICBEES proceeds with the sale and delivery of the ordered products and, on the other hand, to define the rights and obligations of the Parties within the framework of the sale of products by NUMERICBEES to the "customer". They apply, without restriction or reservation, to all sales, by NUMERICBEES, of products offered on its website [https://www.numericbees.com/]

These terms and conditions apply to the exclusion of any other document.

## 2. Products and Prices

### 2.1 Products

The products offered for sale by NUMERICBEES are those presented on the site at the date of consultation by the Internet user, within the limits of available stocks. The photographs illustrating the Products are not contractually binding.

### 2.2 Prices

The prices of the Products are indicated in euros, inclusive of all taxes and including the VAT for the European country concerned applicable on the date of the order. The costs of transporting the Products are not included in the prices of the Products.

NUMERICBEES reserves the right, which the Internet User accepts, to modify the price of its Products at any time. The Products will be invoiced on the basis of the prices in force at the time of validation of the order by the "client", as indicated on the site at the time of the order, subject to the availability of the said products.

## 3. Registration and validation of the order

### 3.1 Navigation within the site

The Internet user may browse freely and without charge through the various pages of the site, without being committed to an order.

The Internet user shall bear the cost of telecommunications when accessing the Internet and using the site.

### 3.20 Offer

On the product page, the "prospect" may obtain an offer for the goods he/she wishes.

They can choose the product or products they want. The unit and total price of the goods selected will be displayed in both VAT and the desired delivery country in Europe. The VAT rate applied will be clearly indicated.

Depending on the country chosen and the delivery method selected, the "prospect" will obtain an offer including delivery, with no surprises.

The "prospect" will have the choice to accept or not the proposed offer, to modify the elements of the offer as he wishes, and to obtain the information he wants.

The duration of the offer is limited to the duration of the Internet user's connection to the product pages, offer and payment of the order. Any other change of page or exit from the NUMERICBEES site will result in the deletion of the offer, and the deletion of the personal data if they have been entered.

If the "prospect" accepts an offer, he/she will be able to proceed to the order stage.

### 3.21 Ordering

During the order stage, the "prospect" :

* Enter the information required to complete the order, i.e. their postal, electronic and telephone details.
* Accepts the processing of his/her personal data by NUMERICBEES, and their transmission to transport and payment service providers for :
    * The completion of his order,
    * Activation of his right to legal guarantees,
    * His information in case of product recall procedure,
* The customer can still modify his potential order - quantities, references, choice of carrier or place of delivery, the offer is updated.
* The customer is informed of the general terms and conditions of sale and accepts them or not by ticking the appropriate box.
    * The acceptance of the general terms and conditions of sale will then allow him/her to proceed to the payment stage if he/she so wishes.
    * If the "prospect" refuses the general terms and conditions of sale, his or her details will be completely deleted when he or she changes pages or leaves the site https://www.numericbees.com
* Acknowledges their legal right of withdrawal and the conditions for using this right described in chapter 8 below, by ticking the appropriate box.

The Internet User is informed and accepts that the entry of his/her details is proof of his/her identity and manifests his/her consent.

Order processing and contact are generally carried out by e-mail. The customer must ensure that the e-mail address provided for order processing is correct, so that e-mails sent by the "seller" can be received at this address. In particular, when using ANTISPAM filters, the customer must ensure that all e-mails sent by the 'seller' or third parties commissioned by the 'seller' to process the order can be delivered.

The "prospect's" order can then be validated by clicking "continue to payment". The "prospect" is redirected to the CREDIT MUTUEL's secure online payment site, called MONETICO PAIEMENT, whose URL address is [https://p.monetico-services.com/paiement.cgi](https://p.monetico-services.com/paiement.cgi), presented in incrustation in the page of the site [https://www.numericbees.com/](https://www.numericbees.com). NUMERICBEES then no longer has access to any personal information of the "prospect", and in particular his bank details.

### 3.3 Final validation and payment of the order

After clicking on "continue to payment", the order data is transmitted to MONETICO PAIEMENT, the electronic payment server of the bank "CREDIT MUTUEL", and the "prospect" is automatically redirected to this server. It is specified that this server is subject to S.S.L. (Secure Socket Layer) security in order to protect all data related to payment methods more effectively, and that at no time will the "customer's" banking data be transmitted on the NUMERICBEES computer system.

The "prospect" may:

* Either abandon his order and delete his data,
* Either modify their order, in which case they return to the site [https://www.numericbees.com/](https://www.numericbees.com)
* Or proceed to payment by completing the MONETICO PAYMENT form and clicking on "pay now".

From the click on "pay now", the "prospect" becomes a "customer". He has registered his order and is considered to have accepted with full knowledge of the facts and without reservation the present general conditions of sale, the prices, volumes and quantities of the products offered for sale and ordered. The financial transaction is carried out by MONETICO PAIEMENT which provides a payment receipt to the "customer" and sends it to him by email.

The order will become irrevocable upon receipt of the full amount by NUMERICBEES, subject to the right of withdrawal stipulated below. The order being final and irrevocable, any request for modification made by the "customer" is subject to acceptance by NUMERICBEES.

The "customer's" bank account will be debited on the day of the order.

Likewise, NUMERICBEES is obliged to deliver products that conform to those ordered, subject to :

* Modifications linked to the technical evolution of the products under the conditions provided for in Article R.212-4 of the Consumer Code,
* In the event of the unavailability of products as stipulated in chapter 7.

NUMERICBEES reserves the right to suspend or cancel any order and/or delivery, whatever its nature and level of execution, in the event of non-payment of any sum due by the "customer", in the event of a payment incident or in the event of an existing dispute with the "customer".

In the context of the fight against Internet fraud, the information relating to your order may be transmitted to any third party for verification.

## 5. Terms of delivery

The order will be executed at the latest within 30 days from the day following the validation by the "customer" of his order.

The products will be delivered to the address indicated by the "customer" on the order form. This address must be consistent with the geographical area chosen during the ordering phase.

Shipments are made by the carrier chosen by the "client" who has the option to track the package on the carrier's website with the tracking number provided.

## 6. Taxes and customs duties

Any order placed on the Site and delivered outside metropolitan France may be subject to possible taxes and customs duties that are imposed when the package reaches its destination. These customs duties and taxes, if any, related to the delivery of an item are the responsibility of the "customer". NUMERICBEES cannot be held responsible for delays and costs related to the customs clearance of deliveries, and is in fact released from any legal responsibility if the payment of taxes was not made by the "customer".

NUMERICBEES is not obliged to check and inform the "customer" of the customs duties and taxes applicable. To know them, NUMERICBEES advises the "customer" to inquire with the competent authorities of the country concerned.

In the case of deliveries to countries outside the European Union, additional costs may arise in particular cases for which the "seller" is not responsible and which are to be borne by the "customer". These are, for example, costs for the transfer of money by credit institutions (e.g. transfer costs, exchange costs) or import duties or taxes (e.g. customs duties). Such costs may also arise in connection with the transfer of money if the delivery is not made to a country outside the European Union, but the customer makes the payment from a country outside the European Union.

## 7 Unavailability of Products

The Products are offered within the limits of available stocks. In the event of unavailability of one of the Products, the "customer" will be informed as soon as possible. This information may be notified to him/her, as far as possible, in the following manner:

* When the order is placed,
* Following the validation of the order, prior to delivery, by e-mail. NUMERICBEES will then take the necessary steps to subtract the price of the unavailable product from the amount debited from the customer's bank account.

In all of the above cases, the "customer" will have the possibility of cancelling the order by requesting a refund of the sums paid within thirty (30) days at the latest after they have been deducted, by e-mail sent to [info@numericbees.com](mailto:info@numericbees.com)
